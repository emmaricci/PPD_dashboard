## Advanced Data Visualization Final Project

Postpartum depression (PPD) is the leading cause of maternal mortality in the United States. However, there are significant gaps in PPD screening, detection, and treatment. A main challenge stems from limitations in existing methods for early PPD diagnosis and subsequent monitoring and intervention. Mobile technology that incorporates interactive interfaces and continuous wearable biosensors holds major potential to augment clinical decision-making and enhance PPD care. A number of compelling research directions exist in effectively developing such systems, including user experience design, sensing accuracy during perinatal stages, clinical integration and interoperability, acceptance and adoption, and privacy and ethics.
